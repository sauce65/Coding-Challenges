#Given a stream of elements too large to store in memory, pick a random element from the stream with uniform probability.

stream = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 99, 345, 76576, 234, 73473, 'kitten', [8, 99, 345, 76576], [3, 5, 7, 8, 99]]

r = rnd.choice(stream) # this feels like cheating.  I feel guilty for doing this in Python.  Too easy!

#Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in #the
#original array except the one at i.

#For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the #expected 
#output would be [2, 3, 6].

#Follow-up: what if you can't use division?

#This function removes i, finds the product of all other
#list items, stores them to list c, then appends i back to
#the original list. uses temporary list b to store i.

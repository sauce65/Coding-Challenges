#Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

#For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17

#etermines if any two numbers in list "a" add up to number "b"
#uses index tracking within while loop to ensure same list item isn't checked against itself
#print(x) and print(y) statements are to bugfix index tracking
#works for all negative and positive integers, not tested on floats

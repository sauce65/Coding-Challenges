# Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space. In other words, find
# the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array. The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.

# For example, the input [3, 4, -1, 1] should give 2. The input [1, 2, 0] should give 3.

# You can modify the input array in-place.

# Since it would be too easy to just see if a list starts at 1 and counts up without skipping, I decided to start
# counting at the first integer in the list and find missing numbers.  If no numbers are missing from the sequence,
# we just report what number would follow in that sequence.

    # List comprehension to convert every string segment into an integer, stores integers in a another list
    cleanList = [i for i in cleanList if i >= 0]

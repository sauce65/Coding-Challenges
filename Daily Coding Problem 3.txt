#Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space. In other words, find 
#the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array. The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.

#For example, the input [3, 4, -1, 1] should give 2. The input [1, 2, 0] should give 3.

#You can modify the input array in-place.


#Finds the lowest positive integer missing from a list.
#Removes all negatives, sorts, then iterates.
#If it makes it through the list, it returns the next integer in sequence
#if it finds a missing integer, it returns that integer and breaks the loop.

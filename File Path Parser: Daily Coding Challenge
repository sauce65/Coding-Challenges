#Suppose we represent our file system by a string in the following manner:
#The string "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext" represents:

#dir
#    subdir1
#    subdir2
#        file.ext
#The directory dir contains an empty sub-directory subdir1 and a sub-directory subdir2 containing a file file.ext.
#
#The string "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext" represents:
#
#dir
#    subdir1
#        file1.ext
#        subsubdir1
#    subdir2
#        subsubdir2
#            file2.ext
#
#The directory dir contains two sub-directories subdir1 and subdir2. subdir1 contains a file file1.ext and an empty second-level 
#sub-directory subsubdir1. subdir2 contains a second-level sub-directory subsubdir2 containing a file file2.ext.#
#We are interested in finding the longest (number of characters) absolute path to a file within our file system. For example, in the 
#second example above, the longest absolute path is "dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext", and its length is 32 (not including the double quotes).
#Given a string representing the file system in the above format, return the length of the longest absolute path to a file in the 
#abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return 0.
#Note:
#The name of a file contains at least a period and an extension.
#The name of a directory or sub-directory will not contain a period.





#the program below is a little more complicated, as I was trying to find the DEEPEST directory path with the most characters.
#this was not the question asked, but I certainly learned a lot about regular expressions and made the basics of a possibly
#useful program which provides an alternative result to the one required by the question, but it still needs work!

#flaws: many.  Mainly, this doesn't auto-detect the main file branch number to reference in the lookback, and
#it doesn't have a contingency for when the terminating file in the path is just a subdir.  This is primitive but
#it works if you configure it for each string you parse
